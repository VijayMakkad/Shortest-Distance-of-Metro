# Shortest-Distance-of-Metro
Finding shortest distance between stations using Dijkstra algorithm in C++
The "Shortest Metro Route Finder Project in C" is a software application designed to help users navigate through a metro or subway system by identifying and providing the shortest route between two specified stations. This project aims to simplify the process of finding the quickest way to travel within a metro network, making it particularly useful for commuters and tourists. It involves the implementation of data structures and algorithms to calculate and display the most efficient route and a user-friendly interface to interact with the system. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the convenience and efficiency of metro travel for users.
